# How Inner Sourcing Can Help Your Platform Teams Thrive

As organizations try to improve the quality of their software delivery and the time to market, they are starting to turn to platform teams as a way of building and maintaining a stable, secure, and scalable foundation for software development (if you ask “why?” then take a look at my previous [article about platform teams](./why-platform-teams-are-the-future-of-software-development.md)).

However, aren’t platforms just another way of creating silos? Some would even state that is a clear disadvantage of the platform team model.

I agree, if you do not find a way to culture collaboration and innovation of the platforms, we will be no better off than with the traditional domains which the DevOps principles have tried to counter.

One way to do this is through inner sourcing, which is the adaptation of open-source principles to platforms and products developed within a single organization. By adopting inner-sourcing principles, organizations can obtain some of the same benefits as they would with open-source projects, including improved communication, transparency, and accountability.

## Benefits of Inner Sourcing for Platform Teams

There are several benefits to using inner sourcing to accelerate the work of platform teams. Some of the key benefits include:

- Improved collaboration: Inner sourcing encourages teams to share knowledge and resources, which can help to improve communication and collaboration within the organization. This can be particularly beneficial for platform teams, which often rely on the expertise and insights of other teams to build and maintain the platform.

- Enhanced transparency: Inner sourcing encourages transparency by making product/platform information and progress visible to all stakeholders. This can help to build trust and confidence between the teams using the platforms, as well as improve the overall quality and reliability of the platforms.
Greater accountability: With inner sourcing, it is possible to provide all stakeholders clear definition of their roles and responsibilities, which can help to improve accountability and reduce the risk of delays or issues.

- Increased innovation: By making it easier for teams to share ideas and collaborate on products/platforms, inner sourcing can help to foster a culture of innovation within the organization. This can be particularly important for platform teams, which need to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices to ensure the platform remains relevant and useful. With inner sourcing principles, it is also easier to scale new features of the platform, if the platform team is busy, a competent team could submit a new pull request with a feature that would have been delayed half a year.

## Key Factors for Inner Sourcing to Be a Success

To make inner sourcing a success, there are several factors that organizations need to consider. These include:

- Clear goals and objectives: It’s important to clearly understand the desired goal of implementing inner sourcing, and to communicate this to all stakeholders. This can help to ensure that everyone is working towards the same target.

- Strong leadership: With inner sourcing, the mechanics of a platform suddenly become public within the company and ensuring that the cogs and gears are well-maintained enough for others to view it requires strong leadership to set the vision, direction, and goals for the platform, as well as providing guidance and support to team members.

- Robust processes and tools: Inner sourcing requires robust processes and tools to support collaboration and communication, such as version control systems, project management tools, and collaboration platforms.

- Strong communication and collaboration: It is key to have strong communication and collaboration when working with any inner-sourced product/platform. This includes internal and stakeholder meetings, clear channels of communication, and a culture of openness and transparency.

- Continuous learning and improvement: As with any software development product it is also true for inner sourcing that those working with this principle should be focused on continuous learning and improvement, by staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices, and continuously seeking ways to improve the platform.

By having these factors in place, organizations should be ready to implement inner sourcing and be able to build scalable platform teams that are well-equipped to drive innovation and achieve success through inner sourcing.

## Final Thoughts

Inner sourcing can be an effective method for improving collaboration and innovation within an organization. It can be particularly beneficial for platform teams. By adopting inner-sourcing principles, organizations can improve communication, transparency, and accountability, which in the end can help accelerate the work of platform teams and yield more successful outcomes.
