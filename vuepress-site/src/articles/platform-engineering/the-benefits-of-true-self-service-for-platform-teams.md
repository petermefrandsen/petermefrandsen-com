# The Benefits of True Self-Service for Platform Teams

> **Self-Service**; the act of enabling teams and individuals to take control of their needs to speed up delivery time, increase the feeling of being in control and ultimately improve the consumer experience.

It sounds quite nice, right? Well, self-service is becoming a central concept in a lot of modern software development, especially when talking about platform teams. Self-service can be an important factor when improving efficiency and reducing the workload of the platform team, as well as enabling teams to be more agile and responsive to changing needs and requirements.

However, if we are talking about true self-service, then it goes beyond simply providing access to resources. In a platform team, this would include upskilling team members as well as consumers of the platform, it requires automation tools and effective processes, it becomes a must to have knowledge management and knowledge sharing and there has to be a shift towards empowering teams to take ownership of their own work.

Letâ€™s enhance the definition above.

> **True Self-Service**; the act of enabling teams and individuals to take control of their needs through simple and lean processes, skilled team members and a knowledge-sharing mentality to increase the feeling of being in control and ultimately improve the consumer experience.

## Benefits of True Self-Service for Platform Teams

True self-service can bring a number of benefits to platform teams, including:

- **Improved efficiency**: True self-service can help to improve efficiency and reduce the workload of the platform team through the empowerment of the team to have access to and use the resources they need independently. This can allow the platform team to focus on more strategic tasks, rather than being bogged down by routine requests and issues.

- **Enhanced agility**: True self-service enables teams to be more agile and responsive to changing needs, as they have the knowledge and skills to troubleshoot and resolve issues on their own. This can accelerate development and improve the speed and quality of software delivery.

- **Greater ownership and accountability**: From true self-service teams have to have ownership of their work thus becoming accountable for the success of their platform. This can help a culture manifest within the company that encourages taking responsibility and being accountable which in the end can drive better outcomes.

- **Enhanced collaboration**: True self-service can also improve collaboration within the organization, as teams are more likely to work together and share knowledge (read my article about inner sourcing on this topic) when they have the skills and resources to be self-sufficient. This can help to improve communication and collaboration within the organization.

## Implementing True Self-Service for Platform Teams

To implement self-service for platform teams, there are several topics worth focusing on:

- **Training and resources**: Self-service requires teams to have the knowledge and skills to troubleshoot and resolve issues on their own. This means providing training and resources to enable these teams in doing so. This includes documentation, guides, and training materials.

- **Culture of ownership and accountability**: Self-service requires a shift in mindset towards empowering teams to take ownership. This means fostering a culture of ownership and responsibility within the organization and promoting the importance of self-service as a central principle.

- **Clear processes and guidelines**: It is important to have clear processes and guidelines on how to access and consume the resources. This includes setting up systems for tracking and managing requests as well as establishing communication channels for teams to get help and support when needed.

Additionally, when implementing self-service it is important to ensure the right competencies are present in the team.

These include:

- **Strong problem-solving skills**: A team member should be able to identify issues and come up with effective solutions.

- **E2E overview**: Individuals working with self-service need to be able to have an E2E perspective on the platform and surrounding processes.

- **Communication skills**: Strong communication skills are essential so that the platform team is able to collaborate effectively and share information and knowledge internally in the team as well as with customers.

- **Technical expertise**: A deep understanding of the platform and the tools and technologies being used is necessary for individuals to be able to troubleshoot and resolve issues that may arise.

- **Customer service skills**: In a self-service model, team members often come in contact with customers seeking support, thus strong customer service skills are essential to ensuring that they are able to effectively assist and resolve any issues that may arise.

## Final Thoughts

True self-service can bring a number of benefits to platform teams, including improved efficiency, enhanced agility, greater ownership and accountability, and enhanced collaboration. By providing training and resources, a culture of ownership and accountability, and establishing clear processes and guidelines, organizations can successfully implement true self-service for their platform teams.
