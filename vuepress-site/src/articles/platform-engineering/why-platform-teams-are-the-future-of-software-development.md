# Why Platform Teams Are the Future of Software Development

_A point of view on the current course of software development organisations, where Platform teams have a central role._

Previously and even today software development has been done in silos, with each team focusing on a specific domain or function. This required handovers between teams, such as when software developers needed to pass their work to an operations team. However, with the emergence of DevOps teams, there was a shift towards more integrated and collaborative approaches to software development, with teams being responsible for all aspects of the development process, including infrastructure, security, testing, and more.

While the DevOps approach brought many benefits, it can be challenging to implement, especially in larger organizations. That’s why many companies are now turning to platform teams as a more effective way to organize their software development efforts.

## What are Platform Teams?

Platform teams are internal teams responsible for building and maintaining a platform that other teams can use. These platforms can be used to develop, test, and deploy applications and even cover aspects including and not limited to the underlying infrastructure and security and the development tools and processes. The goal of a platform team is to provide a stable and secure and scalable foundation for software development, enabling other teams to focus on their core competencies.

## Benefits of Platform Teams
There are several benefits to adopting a platform team model for software development. Some of the key benefits include:

- **Roadmaps**: Platform teams outline the direction and goals of the platform through roadmaps. These roadmaps are used to ensure that the platform remains relevant and valuable to the needs of the organisation.

- **Critical mass**: Similarly to traditional silos one benefit is that a platform team brings together a large team of experts in a specific domain thus achieving a critical mass of knowledge and skill that can drive innovation and improve quality.

- **High expertise**: As mentioned around the critical mass, platform teams often focus on a technical domain, allowing them to develop deep expertise in that area. This can help ensure that the platform is well-maintained and can support the organisation.

- **Operations focus**: Instead of handing over the entire platform to an operations team the platform team often remains responsible for development tasks. This ensures that operation teams can focus on maintaining and optimizing the platform, which can lead to more efficient and effective operations.

- **Consuming platforms and products**: Platform teams can also help organizations to consume other platforms and products more effectively, by providing a stable and reliable foundation for integration. This can help to accelerate development and improve the quality of the final product(s).

## Key Factors for Success

To ensure the success of a platform team, it’s important to be on top of several factors. These include and are not limited to:

- A clear roadmap that outlines the direction and goals of the team
- Strong leadership to provide guidance and support
- Diverse and skilled team with a range of expertise
- Robust processes and tools to support their work
- Strong communication and collaboration
- Focus on continuous learning and improvement.

Additionally, self-service can be an important focus while building scalable platforms, as it enables users to access and use the platform independently and effectively, which can help to improve efficiency and reduce the workload of the platform team.

## How to Organise Around Platforms

One of the challenges in implementing a platform team model is figuring out how to organize around the platforms. In the past, organizations have commonly been organized around technologies or domains, such as network, security, or on-premises and cloud. However, this can lead to siloed thinking and can be difficult to scale as platforms become more complex and hybrid in nature.

Instead, I suggest organizing around functionality or capability as it seems more scalable and effective. For example, you might have software development platforms, end-user device platforms, HR platforms, project management platforms, finance platforms, etc. With the platform team approach, you can group platforms based on their purpose and the needs of the teams that will be using them, rather than being limited by specific technologies or domains.

## Final Thoughts

As the world continues to get more and more digitalized and the need for effective and scalable software development gets more and more prominent, platform teams are emerging as a way for organizations to improve the speed and quality of their software delivery. By building and maintaining a platform that can be used by other teams, organizations can achieve scale, technical excellence, and potentially more efficient operations.

I’d say that if you’re considering adopting a platform team model for your organization, now is the time to start planning and preparing.
