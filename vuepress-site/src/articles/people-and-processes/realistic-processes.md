# Processes, the challenge of making them realistic

You as a company, department or team have grown and you have found out that the past months or year has been rather turbulent either regarding the quality or how you have handled the tasks coming in. You call to action and want to implement structure to your work and start on the whole "process journey".

If you do not have the competencies in the company most managers hire externals to solve this task whereas others may assign it to an employee; with the best intentions but often a "you are it!" kind of way.

Either way, I guess that when you are done you have something that probably will not be used to its full potential, might be hated by the employees or remains untouched collecting dust.

So what is going wrong? Why don't the processes not provide any actual value or even hinder the way my employees work?

For starters, processes are not magic nor are they something that makes anything better but **working with processes** does.

If you are one of those companies or people that just got everything figured out regarding processes, read my article and humour me with some thoughts. Do you agree, disagree or something in between? I have often found that some of the simplest topics are the most difficult to master.

## What is a process?
A process is _"a series of actions or steps taken to achieve a particular end."_ and the goal of a process should be as simple as possible.

A process should not have any secret tasks that the executing party is not aware of and for processes to provide any actual value they need to be useable. Useable processes are when they are close to actual implementation.

If a workflow is very complex the process may end up being so as well. However, it must never be the case that a simple workflow ends up having a complex process.

When you create processes it is important to live by the KISS principle (Keep It Simple Stupid). Why? Because when you try to follow or manage a complex process the chances of errors will be greater than if you have multiple but simpler processes.

## Who is working with processes?

### Internal employees

If you did not have the budget, chances are that you have assigned the task of working with processes to an internal employee. Chances are also that this employee does not have a passion for processes and simply sees it as a "task to be done".

The case just is that working with processes is a continuous task that always will require some attention.

On the flip side, you will have an employee working with processes that most like knows how you work and you may get an outcome that represents reality. Additionally, you most certainly will have someone who can state what does not work as it is right now.

### Consultants

In the case that you had a budget, you most likely have hired one or more consultants to work with your processes and document these.

In this case, you pay a rather large sum of money for some to go through your company and they often are rather good at that as well! But one pitfall is that they often drive this area themselves, and then the employees end up not feeling that this work is done **for** them and not **with** them. Another pitfall is that the consultants may not have the necessary technical competencies to drive the work from a high level to a practical/usable level.

### Who should work with my processes?

To be honest, both scenarios have their pros and cons and for you to benefit the most you would have to use both internal and external resources; unless of course, you have a dedicated process department.

## Let us get started - we need to be better ASAP!

We need to be better! Does not it sound familiar?

Focussing solely on the TO/BE setup often leads to omitting to document what you currently do in a detailed enough fashion. Instead, you risk ending up with a high-level AS/IS process that does not provide actual value because it is not something the employees can use.

**To get better, you need to know where you are at, which is why it is important to work properly with your current processes.**

For 9 out of 10 cases, you would need to work on documenting the existing processes (documented or not) because even Proof of Concept (POC) projects would have resulted in you working with the task and thereby having a process.

> If you have worked with it, then there already exists at least one process

Throughout documenting the existing process you may find that the process consists of 1–5 different ways of working, so the next step will be to **streamline or align** that existing process into one main process.

After streamlining your processes you are now ready to work on getting better.

## Continuous Improvement

When you have documented your current processes to a detailed enough level so that it would be possible for a new hire to follow them, you can then proceed on working on improving how you work.

Here you will ask "Why do we do this flow/task and why in this order?" and upon receiving these answers from management and employees you will then be able to find the major pain points that impede the work done or that do not follow certain standards.

Then you will ask "How can we improve?" by including the people working within the area as well as including other parties for ideas of improvement.

The important thing here is that the final process and tasks should feel natural and as something that provides value to the executing parties, not just something "because I say so".

### How often do I need to evaluate my processes?

There sadly no one fits all and I will have to say that it depends on what you are working with, how well you mature as a company/department/team and how big the changes you work with are.

For example, if you are changing the tool used for a specific task within a process you may be able to look at new improvements one or two months later. But if you are looking at restructuring a process we may be talking about one to two years.

## Process for working with processes

All of the above results in a rather simple process.

1. Document AS/IS in a detailed fashion

2. Streamline the AS/IS to the degree so a new hire can perform the work without help from a colleague

3. Identify pain points that you change to improve

4. Perform changes to the process in question

5. Follow up on those changes

6. Start from step 3. again.

## When you have something new (the 1 in 10)

If you have not worked with the area before and you need to implement a process for this area, you cannot use any existing processes.

What you can do is find a similar process. So if you are working with maturity evaluation as I write about in [Measuring the maturity of a team/company](./measuring-maturity-teamcompany.md) then you may look for similar processes such as people review, competence mapping or even some legislation requirements, e.g. an environmental impact analysis. Thus, bringing the methodology closer to the common 9 out of 10 cases.

Let us assume that you already have defined the teams, categories and category levels for the maturity evaluation so it is more about process implementation rather than the method itself.

As the maturity evaluation focuses on teams and the company, the people review is not the best fit. However, if you have worked with competence mapping of teams or e.g. an environmental impact analysis, then you already have a "process" in place that may be useable for doing a maturity evaluation.

Here you should start by investigating the processes and how they are being done. Afterwards, you would have to use them directly or slightly modify these so you would be able to do an initial evaluation with as little impact as possible on the day-to-day work performed.

Doing this would bring some learnings that then can be used to improve the process or even make the evaluation part of another more 'day to day'/'month to month' basis.

> For new processes try to identify something similar you can use for an initial outline. If not, then you truely have to "invent a process" or seek knowledge outside our company
