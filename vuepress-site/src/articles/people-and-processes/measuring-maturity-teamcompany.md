# Measuring the maturity of a team/company

Maturity. The "state, fact or period of being mature" and according to Oxford Languages 'mature' can be defined as "having reached the most advanced stage in a process".

Why is maturity relevant?

Well measuring the maturity of a team or even a company does not provide any real or direct value, but how this measurement is used is where the real benefits are.

Each maturity measurement is a representation of the current state of a team/company and can be used for continuous improvement. In some Quality Management Systems, e.g., ISO 9001, continuous improvement is a requirement, and implementing this in companies is rather common.

Although measuring the quality itself is something many do, using a maturity model is a task some teams hate doing.

Therefore, I have taken some time thinking about how to implement a maturity model and use that for evaluating a company. This may of course backfire with a lot of responses containing similar or better methodologies, in fact, [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MaturityModel.html) has already written about the maturity model back in 2014.

**DISCLAIMERS**

## In short

The basic idea is scoring a company or even a specific team on how mature they are and by doing that being able to evaluate their state of maturity.

Of course, one issue with evaluating specific teams is that you have a risk of ending up with dissatisfied employees because you indirectly score teams against each other, even though it is with the best intentions. It is therefore important that each team/team lead evaluate themselves to get an initial score.

Another hurdle is that self-assessment often leans towards being slightly or **unrealistically positive**. This can be a result of the fact that you are measured on performance or even are afraid of being laid off because of a bad evaluation. It is important to remember these measurements aren't everything and that it is **A LOT better to have an evaluation close to reality rather than one hiding potentials**. Additionally, do not create KPI's that focus on the initial score but instead improve from that point forward.

To reduce these complications a self-assessment may cause, you can include another role/party to evaluate with the team. This party should have in-depth knowledge about the team and similar teams' areas of responsibility.

- An average of the team scores will be the company's maturity.

- To find the maturity goal/target, a similar task needs to be done by directors/managers and the parties with in-depth knowledge.

- The directors/managers will give their take on where the company should be now, in a year, 3 and/or 5 years.

- The parties with in-depth knowledge will do the same and together with the directors/managers agree on a final score.

- An average of the final goal scores will be the company target score.

- These average team and company goal scores give the possibility to work with continuous improvement.

## Scoring method

The scoring method is simple. You have multiple categories each divided into 5 maturity levels.

Level 1 is the easiest to fulfil and level 5 is the most difficult.

Each level needs to be described and be specific enough for the teams to evaluate what level they are at.

Additionally, the levels act as gates, you cannot be on level 2 if you do not pass level 1. This would force the teams to reach a minimum quality consisting of the same competencies rather than doing complex work before managing the basics. If a team cannot pass level 1, the score will be 0 for that category.

Each category can be weighted in importance, and by doing so a company can force a certain focus. This focus could e.g., be weighting IT and software security higher than other categories.

## Scoring categories

When measuring the maturity of a company it is important that you strive to cover all aspects of the work done in that company, in this article called categories.

The definition of each category and its levels needs to be static to be able to compare each evaluation and thereby the continuous improvement of the team/company.

If the categories aren't static you cannot measure progress unless you revaluate/re-score previous measurements.

If a score comparison of companies is desired the companies need to use what would be like a Standard Evaluation Method. This method would in general consist of categories and definitions the companies can agree upon.

The Standard Evaluation Method for Software Development could consist of the following scoring categories:

- Source control
- Writing code
- CI/CD
- Testing
- Security
- Documentation
- Operation
- Working Method

Each category should contain the definition of levels 1 through 5 for each category.

## What about old and outdated methodologies, processes, and technologies?

An issue with scoring a methodology, process and technology is that what you do today may not be the same as what you once did a year ago. You may even not have an interest in changing the methodologies, processes or technologies of those outdated areas.

To handle this, you could separate the evaluation into two parts: one for old and outdated and one for the new. Let's call it **legacy** and **modern**.

With a weighted average of the legacy and modern scores, it will be possible to give each team a single score. Furthermore, the legacy and modern maturity scores can be used as a tool for continuous improvement.

The modern maturity score can also be used as a tool for heightening the competencies within the team/company as well as targeting what should be in focus for new projects.
